- Ticks at fix rate(s) ?
  - Slow tick / realtime tick?
- Message based commmand queue?
  - Respond to commands like spawn
  - Run "systems" on a event or triggered manually
  - Respond to queries
    - Is this just triggered systems?
  - Triggering systems
  - Set values
  - Tick time forward?
  - Publish updates
    - Instead of request / response
    - This means we can push commands mid "tick" so like if earlier we SET that may append a NOTIFY
- ECS Like system 
- One shot commands for stuff like spawning instead of "bundles"
- Systems run one per region or cell? 
- Message based is easy to tap for logging and replays.. hmmmm
- Queue per region or zone?
- Engine instance per region or zone?
